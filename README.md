# Python Tutorials
Python tutorials I made for a friend, not designed for use in a classroom. Currently a work in progress. These tutorials assume you understand what variables and if statements do, other than that designed for beginners and will not cover advance applications of Python. Each assignment is represented by a folder and countain the assignment and an autograder to help confirm code works.

## How to use Assignments
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure to download python 3.0 or later).
- Download repository.
- Navigate to folder of interest.
- Open non-grader file in preffered code editor.
- Follow instructions within.

## Planned Additions
- Redo explanations on function assignment
- Project where you create a simple navigation AI for creature
- Simple Encryption/Decryption project to further demonstrate how for loops work.
- Saving system project to show how to write and read from files.
- Project where you convert image into an ascii image
- Assignment on objects.
- Assignment on while loops.
